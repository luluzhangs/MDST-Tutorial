These metrics indicate that while the model can predict math scores to a certain extent, its overall explanatory power is limited, capturing only a small fraction of the variance in the math scores. This suggests that 4th-grade math scores are influenced by a multitude of factors beyond just the financial expenditure per student, and incorporating additional predictors could potentially improve the model's accuracy and explanatory power."
